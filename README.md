THE PROBLEM:
Dev teams waste 15+ hours/week on delays. Code reviews take 4+ days. 
This costs $50,000 per team monthly.

THE SOLUTION:
DevFlow AI uses machine learning to predict bottlenecks 2-3 days 
before they happen, then suggests fixes automatically.

RESULTS (25 developers, 4 weeks):
- 96% faster PR merges
- 40% productivity gain
- 83% fewer blocked tasks
